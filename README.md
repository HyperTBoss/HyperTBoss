# Hello~
### My name is HyperTBoss, my real name to be Akeem.

Now, to quickly get to know me, I shall cover the basics. My goals, collaboration, intrests, learning and how to reach me.

# Goals
- To take part in developing linux, Godot and any other open source projects that intertest me.
- Find a job in any field. But if possible, IT or Game/Sofeware Development.
- Write a couple of novels before time takes me.
- Draw frequently, I don't know how frequent that will be.
- Produce music, hopefully getting a piano in the future to do that more easily.
